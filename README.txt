For my generation file, CS4120Project1C.cpp, compile it. Then, for each file that you want to output, just write the number of the 
samples wanted. For example, if you want a file with 5000 samples, input (./executable) 5000 
these will give files of "database5000.txt", "database1000.txt", etc.

Make sure when you use these database files to put them in the same directory as the .cpp files for the linear search
and merge sort + binary search files, else they will not be able to access them. 

To run the LinearSearch.cpp file, just do the same as above, compile it then do ./executable database5000.txt
you can replace the database5000.txt argument with any of the generated files and it will output results.
The first result in this is the merge sort time, the second is the binary search time.

To run the MergeSortBinarySearch.cpp file, just do the same as above, compile it then do ./executable database5000.txt
you can replace the database5000.txt argument with any of the generated files and it will output results.
The first result in this is the merge sort time, the second is the binary search time.
